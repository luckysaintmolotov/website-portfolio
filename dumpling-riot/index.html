<h1>The Global Journey of Dumplings</h1>

<p>Dumplings trace their roots back more than two millennia to ancient China, where early recipes for jiaozi emerged during the Eastern Han dynasty (25 – 220 AD). Legend credits the physician Zhang Zhongjian with wrapping seasoned meat in dough to treat frostbitten villagers, and those simple pockets of warmth quickly became woven into winter traditions. <br>

<p>Meanwhile, long before modern ravioli or pierogi, the Roman gourmand Apicius recorded poached dough balls stuffed with roasted pheasant, fat, and spices. These early European dumplings reveal that the impulse to encase savory fillings in dough was truly a shared invention across continents.<br>

<p>As trade and migration spread across the Silk Road, the concept evolved: in Japan, gyoza took on a crisp pan-fried edge; in Korea, mandu found its way into steaming broths; in Mongolia, buuz celebrated nomadic feasts. At the same time, Eastern Europe perfected pierogi and Germany simmered knödel alongside rich stews, each culture adapting the dumpling to local tastes and ingredients. <br>

<p>Today, dumplings remain a universal symbol of community and creativity. From bustling night markets to family-style feasts, these versatile pockets continue to bridge culinary worlds, reminding us how a simple dough wrapper can carry the weight of centuries of human connection.</p>
