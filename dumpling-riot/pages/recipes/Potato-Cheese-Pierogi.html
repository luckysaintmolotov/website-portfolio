    <p>The recipe yields 55 dumplings, but don't worry if you aren't feeding a crowd—they'll keep nicely in your freezer (just freeze them first on a cookie sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag). Serve with caramelized onions, sautéed Brussels sprouts, or cabbage and apples.</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 pound potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/4 whole onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 ounces farmer's cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 stick melted butter</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Start with the filling: Peel potatoes and roughly chop into 1-inch pieces. Place in a medium-sized pot, cover with water and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer and cook until fork-tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>While potatoes are cooking, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium, add the chopped onion and cook until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Once potatoes are cooked, drain them and mash until smooth. Add farmer’s cheese, onions and 1 pinch each salt and pepper. Mix well, taste, and add more seasonings and cheese if necessary. Set the filling aside while you make the dough.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>To make the dough, heat the milk until it’s hot but not scalding. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, hot milk, sour cream, melted butter, egg yolks, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Knead until the mixture forms a smooth ball, then cover and let dough rest for 20 minutes. Flour a cutting board or other surface, then use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until it’s 1/8-inch thick. Cut circles using a biscuit cutter or a floured glass.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>Place about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the potato-cheese filling in the middle of each circle. Wet one half of the circle and then seal the edges together. You can crimp the edges with a fork, or not. If you end up with extra filling, you can serve it the way you would mashed potatoes, or make potato pancakes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>To cook, boil a large pot of salted water. Add in the pierogi, 8 at a time. Once they float to the surface, let them cook for one more minute. Take them out with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>If you want to fry them after they are boiled, put an extra tablespoon of butter in a saucepan and cook them for a few minutes on each side until they’re golden brown. Serve with sour cream and additional melted butter.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
